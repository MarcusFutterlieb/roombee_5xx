This code was created to allow you to transform your vacuum cleaner into a fun robot development platform. With the help of the free toolbox "The MATLAB Toolbox for the iRobot Create", a free toolbox developed by Professor Joel Esposito and Owen Barton at the United States Naval Academy in the Systems Engineering Department this software package was realized.


The projects main purpose is to control a IRobot Roomba of the 500 series with your laptop, a usb to serial cable and Matlab.
